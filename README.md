# Word_Guess_Game

## Musical Hangman
This is a web based game of picking letters one at a time in order to guess a
hidden word.  When the page loads a hidden word is chosen and the characters
are displayed as underscores at the top of the screen.  Press a letter key
to choose a letter to guess.  If you are right, the letter will be displayed
in the underscored characters at the top.  If you are wrong you will lose one
of your five guesses that are displayed as musical notes.  When you guess the
word or run out of guesses you will be told what the word was (a musical genre)
and a song from youtube will be played from that genre.  A new game will start
immediately upon the previous game ending.

### Hard Mode
Hard mode can be activated by clicking the toggle swith at the top right of the
page.  When hard mode is activated the pool of genre words will change to a 
larger array of more obscure genres.

# Enjoy!
